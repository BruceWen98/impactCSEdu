# impactCSEdu

This code is my submission for the inaugural UChicago Coding Challenge.

The Challenge: There are a surprising number of Chicago neighborhoods that don't have any informal K-12 computer science programs. Given a particular neighborhood, it costs a certain amount of dollars to set up a CS program at a local school, and has a potential to impact students.  Given D amount of dollars in funding, write a function to determine how many students you could impact by setting up CS programs in certain neighborhoods.   

Inputs: 
int D : Number of dollars in available in funding           
arr[] : an array of tuples (cost, impact) where the first value is the cost and the second value is the impact of setting up a CS program in           that neighborhood.   

Output: The maximal number of students impacted by setting up programs without exceeding our funding amount of D dollars.
